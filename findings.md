**Phishing mail**

Powerful and popular attack for hacking via mails. The cyber criminals use this attack to hack into bank accounts, facebook accounts and email accounts. Deadly attack with consequences. 

The phishing emails are an easy way to manipulate people into clicking or downloading malicious links or content. There are many tools to these techniques but the only way to escape these phishing mails are to get aware on such mails. 

**1.Phishing emails will not coming from the legal address or legal domain. All ways check the sent domain. They mess up with the domain name, so that it seems like legitimate but not.**

Eg: support@micr0soft.com  
support1ogin@gmail.com  
googleservice@mail.com 

So no such domain name mails are valid. The sender doesn't want you to send the reply mail so the content will be purely focusing on clicking the links, downloading the files and an urgent response subject.

**2. The mail comes with many details but we ignore them as we are more focused on the content. The users can look at sent by and signed by and encryption fields.**  
With such attacks they dont involve names, if involved it genuine.If the request seems strange, send reply to the mail asking for confirmation.

**3. Do not trust the from field. The attackers are manipulaters, that they dont give a reason to doubt. Lets say you have a mail from support.amazonsupport@gmail.com, it passed the test of domain name right? But is it valid? NO this mail is not valid one.**

Mostly when the domain seems off , just open https://verifalia.com/validate-email , an open source tool where it checks if the mail matches the rules and valid or not.

**4. Most importantly, the links you see are the main key here. The payload injected mails are just http links. Which are not secured, we are far more a head than the HTTP, all the sites are now secured with HTTPS port. Now you can imagine if you click the link the malicious payload gets to you system and your sensitive information.**

Here the attacker smart enough to show the link as https but when you hover the link, you can see the real url we are about to click. ALWAYS BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU ARE CLICKING. This simple technique can save us. 

**5. Lastly, we can also check the number of users the mail got shared. This type comes under fishing, but better to check this too. When the filters are so perfect and covered, many fraudulent emails get caught here.**

**HERE, THE MAIN QUESTION IS, IS EMAIL NOT PERFORMING ITS WORK ON SECURING THE MAILS ?**

Yes, the mail is a software-as-a-service cloud model which performs securing the mails and stopping the fraud mails. The fraudulent mails are verified and filtered with a spam tag, so all mails in spam are considered spam. No. The spam mails are filtered by performing multiple technical, behavioural, and context-based filter checks.  
DKIM - Domain Keys Identified Mail  
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)  
Reverse DNS  
HELO /EHLO validation  
Unsubscribe link should be there  
Domain age and reputation  
With all the checks, the mail is sent to spam.

**Phishing Types**

**Deceptive phishing**  
Where attacker sends you a fake email asking you to click the link and verify the account details.  
Let's say i have a phishing mail stating an immediate login is required with the link, and i see the site as http://facebooks.com. And when I have clicked the link, i see the Facebook login page. When the credentials are entered, the page doesn't get to your account; the credentials will be with the attacker now. Many of us are aware of enabling the MFA Multi-Factor Authentication. DOES THIS HELP? ABSOLUTELY!!!  
Now the credentials are with the attacker, and even if he logs in, with the multi-factor authentication, he can't just walk through the account.

Even with the additional security, we have to be careful and see the backs, as the password is with the attacker, he may use this to try combinations to other website accounts that are not secured properly. Ultimately, the goal is to manipulate to get the credentials and all.

**Spear phishing**  
This type of phishing targets specific individuals instead of a group. Through social engineering, they get to your email and send malicious emails. Attacker follows the motive.  
E.g: The mail appears to download the invoice. Such big attacks should send the mail more convincing and correct message so one can look into it. Big the attack, big the payload.

**Whaling**  
This whaling is also considered phishing only difference is that for phishing attacker gets to common people's credentials and all. But whaling is far more; this targets the bigger fish. They go for the CEO, COO kinda people. High executives to a great extent.  
Let's assume I, as a COO, performing and maintaining the organization through a network, deal with n number of emails. And I see an email from the CEO asking about the deals for the current project. Do I doubt that? NO because the writing mail pattern seems the same as CEO.

This is the HUGE difference between phishing mail and whaling mail. The whaling mail is sent with such perfection, matching the correct format. What can an attacker do with such details? He will just be a mediator, selling the information to rival companies.  

**Pharming**  
Similar to phishing, this pharming attack redirects users from legitimate website to a fraudulent one. So he can get to sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or financial information. 

**Voice Phishing**  
The attacker calls and appears to be someone else, getting the information required. The voice changer apps are just an additional mask to this type of attack. The calls of kidnapping, lottery winning, and emergency credentials are all teh part of and the most used fraud calls. 

**DIFFERENT TYPES BUT SAME INTENTION.** 

**Prevention**

There is no prevention; with the coming tools and technologies the best remedy is user awareness.  
Layered security approach. MFA is the best approach in case of credential leaks.
