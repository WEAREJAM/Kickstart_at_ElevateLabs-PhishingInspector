This document is a deep analysis and techniques to identify a phishing email. This readme is just a brief description on what all i have covered.

**Analyzing Email Headers:**  
Explained how to read and understand fields like "From", "Sent by", "Signed by", and "Encryption". Highlighted how attackers spoof legitimate-looking addresses and domains.

**Domain Validation:**  
Discussed how phishing mails often come from fake or suspicious domains. Used examples like `support@micr0soft.com` and explained how to verify them using tools like [Verifalia](https://verifalia.com/validate-email).

**Link Inspection:**  
Detailed how attackers mask malicious links and how users can hover to inspect the real destination. Emphasized the importance of HTTPS over HTTP and explained how link redirection can lead to payload downloads.

**Visual Awareness:**  
Included visual examples (like the one below) to show how phishing mails are designed to trick the eye, with subtle changes in sender names, domains, and logos.

**Technical Checks Behind Spam Filtering:**  
Explored how email providers use filters like SPF, DKIM, DMARC, reverse DNS, and others to classify and handle phishing emails.

**Different Types of Phishing:**  
Documented multiple forms of phishing attacks — from deceptive phishing and spear phishing to whaling, pharming, and voice phishing (vishing). Each type is explained with examples and prevention tips.

**Preventive Measures:**  
Stressed the importance of user awareness as the first line of defense. Encouraged practices like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), link checking, domain validation, and being cautious before responding to urgent emails.

**Real Examples and Findings:**  
This project is filled with real patterns seen in phishing emails. The findings are structured from a user-awareness point of view — how to detect phishing as a non-technical person but also how to dig deeper with technical tools.
